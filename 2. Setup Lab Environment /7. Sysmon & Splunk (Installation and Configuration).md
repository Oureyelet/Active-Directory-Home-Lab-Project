<b>Objective: Todays objective is to installing and configuring Sysmon and Splunk on your Windows target machines and server within a VirtualBox environment. This setup will enable them to collect system telemetry and forward logs to the Splunk server for analysis.</b>

<p>Sysmon (System Monitor) is a system monitoring and logging tool that is a part of the Windows Sysinternals Suite. It generates much more detailed and expansive logs than the default Windows logs, and it provides a great, free alternative to many of the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions available.</p>

<b>If you notice that it's using this account NT SERVICE Splunk folder it might not be able to collect logs due to some of the permissions so instead you want to select 'Local system account' and hit 'apply' it will say 'hey the new log on name will not take affect until you stop and restart service' which is what we will do because we updated our inputs.conf file :</b>
