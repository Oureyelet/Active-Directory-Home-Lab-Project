controller and configure the target machines to join our newly created domain.</b>

<b>Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft service that provides centralized authentication and 
authorization to network resources. It’s used in business environments to simplify user 
management, control access to data, and enforce security policies. AD is a key component of 
the Windows Server operating system, and it’s structured as a hierarchical database that stores 
information about objects on the network, such as user accounts, computers, printers, and 
security policies.</b>

<b>Promoting a server to a domain controller (DC) is a process in Active Directory (AD) where a 
server is elevated to have the authority to manage domain resources, such as user accounts, 
computers, and security policies. This process is essential when setting up a new domain or 
adding a DC to an existing domain to improve redundancy and load balancing.</b>

<b>Joining a domain in Active Directory (AD) is the process of adding a computer to a domain, 
allowing it to be managed centrally and to access resources like shared files, printers, and 
applications that are controlled by the domain. When a computer joins a domain, it becomes a 
member of that domain and is subject to its security policies and administrative controls.</b>
