<b>Objective: Now that we have our Active Directory set up and our server is now a domain controller we will now head over to our Windows target machine and join it to our newly created domain called 'homelab.local' and authenticate one of our two account we jsut created.</b>

<b>On our Windows 10 machine we want to search uo PC and then click on 'properties':</b>

<hr>

<b>This is becouse our target machine does not know how to resolve my homelab.local and this all goes back to how DNS works now to fix this we can head over to our network adaptar and right-click 'Open Network and Ethernet Settings':</b>

<b>Click on 'Change adapter options':</b>

<b>And if you look at our DNS server it is pointing to Google's DNS:</b>

<hr>

<b>We want to change this pointing to our domain controller which is hosted on 192.168.10.7 and then hit 'ok':</b>

<hr>

<b>Now just to make sure everything is good to go we will type in CMto open our command prompt 
 and then i will type in 'ipconfig/all' this will show our DNS server and in this case we can see that it is pointing to our domain controller:</b>

<hr>

<b>So now in theory we should can connect to our homelab.local in System Properties:</b>

<hr>

<b>And now we are prompted to enter in some credentials we will use administrator account of the server to log in as this account will have the proper permissions so type in 'administrator' and password:</b>

<hr>

<b>In the real world environment you would create users and put them into a custom group that are authorized to allow computers to join the domain and we do see the window popup saing 'Welcome to the homelab.local domain':</b>

<b>It will say 'You must restart your computer to apply this changes' so let's go ahead and close it out and you will be prompted to restart now or later so let's do now:</b>

<b>Once we are on the log on screen we want to log in with our newly created user:</b>

<b>And that is how we create a new user join our computer to a new domain and log in as a domain user.</b>
