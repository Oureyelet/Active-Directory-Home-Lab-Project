# Active-Directory-Home-Lab-Project
Setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux &amp; Atomic Red Team.

This project aims to build a home lab environment to learn and practice Microsoft Active Directory (AD). It will utilize virtual machines (VMs) running on VirtualBox to create a simulated domain network.

<b>Goals:</b>

Active Directory: Set up a fully functional on-premises Active Directory domain controller.
Security Integration: Integrate Splunk (Security Information and Event Management) with Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team for security analysis and attack simulation. This will allow you to explore how a domain environment works, ingest security events into SIEM, and generate simulated attack telemetry.

<b>Benefits:</b>

Gain hands-on experience with Active Directory management.
Learn how to integrate security tools for threat detection and analysis.
Understand how Active Directory interacts with security measures.

<b>Next Steps:</b>

Environment Setup: Install and configure VirtualBox.
Active Directory Deployment: Set up a Windows Server VM and promote it to a domain controller.
Security Tools Integration: Install and configure Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team VMs.
Testing and Learning: Experiment with user management, security policies, and simulated attacks within your lab environment.
