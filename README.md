# Active-Directory-Home-Lab-Project
Setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux &amp; Atomic Red Team.

This project aims to build a home lab environment to learn and practice Microsoft Active Directory (AD). It will utilize virtual machines (VMs) running on VirtualBox to create a simulated domain network.

<b id="Goals">Goals:</b>

Active Directory: Set up a fully functional on-premises Active Directory domain controller.
Security Integration: Integrate Splunk (Security Information and Event Management) with Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team for security analysis and attack simulation. This will allow you to explore how a domain environment works, ingest security events into SIEM, and generate simulated attack telemetry.
