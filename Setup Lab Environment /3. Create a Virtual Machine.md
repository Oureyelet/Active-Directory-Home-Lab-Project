<b>Objective: Create a Virtual Machine</b>

<p>In this README file, we’ll walk through the steps to create a virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox. A VM allows you to run a separate operating system within your existing host system. We’ll focus on setting up a Windows 10 VM. Step-by-Step Instructions below:</p>

<hr>

<b>Open VirtualBox and click on “New” to create a new VM:</b>

<hr>

<b>Provide a name for your VM (e.g., “Windows 10 VM”). Choose the directory where you want to store your VM files. Select the appropriate operating system type (e.g., Windows) and version (e.g., Windows 10 64-bit). Click “Next.” Also we need to select here ISO image which we've done it here: https://github.com/Oureyelet/Active-Directory-Home-Lab-Project/blob/main/Setup%20Lab%20Environment%20/2.%20ISO%20File%20For%20Windows%2010.md </b>

<hr>

<b>(Allocate Resources) Configure the VM specifications based on your computer’s resources: Memory (RAM): Allocate an appropriate amount of RAM. For a Windows 10 VM, 4GB is a good starting point. CPU: Assign at least one CPU core. Click “Next.”:</b>

<hr>

<b>Set the size of the virtual hard disk. The default 50GB should suffice for a basic Windows 10 installation. Click “Create.”:</b>

<b>Powering Up the Virtual Machine: In VirtualBox, select your newly created VM from the list. Click the “Start” button (it looks like a green arrow or play button) to power up the VM. Follow the on-screen prompts to install the operating system (in this case, Windows 10) using the ISO image you attached earlier. Once the installation is complete, you’ll have a fully functional Windows 10 virtual machine!:</b>
