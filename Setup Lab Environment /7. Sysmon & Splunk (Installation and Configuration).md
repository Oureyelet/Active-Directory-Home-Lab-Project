<b>Objective: Todays objective is to install and cofigure both sysmon and Splunk onto our Windows target machine and windows server so they can start collecting telemetry and sent logs over to our Splink server.</b>

<p>Sysmon (System Monitor) is a system monitoring and logging tool that is a part of the Windows Sysinternals Suite. It generates much more detailed and expansive logs than the default Windows logs, and it provides a great, free alternative to many of the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions available.</p>
