<b>Objective: Todays objective is to installing and configuring Sysmon and Splunk on your Windows target machines and server within a VirtualBox environment. This setup will enable them to collect system telemetry and forward logs to the Splunk server for analysis.</b>

<p>Sysmon (System Monitor) is a system monitoring and logging tool that is a part of the Windows Sysinternals Suite. It generates much more detailed and expansive logs than the default Windows logs, and it provides a great, free alternative to many of the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions available.</p>

<b>To begin you want to head over to our virtual box and we want to make sure that our network settings are set to NAT network this way our virtual machines can be on the same network and still have internet access to do this open Virual Box: </b>

<b>Then we want to clik on 'Tools' and on the bullet points and you need to make sure you selected 'Network': </b>

<b>Over to the tabs on top bar we need to select 'NAT Network' and click on 'Create': </b>

<b>At the bottom give your network a name (e.g., AD Project) and I'll have the ipv4 prefix as our IP that we put in our diagram 192.168.10.0/24 and I will leave enable DHCP and I will hit apply:</b>

<b>Good job now we just created our own NAT network called: AD project.</b>

<hr>

<b>Lets head over to our Splunk server in Virtual Box We want to select here 'Settings' becouse now we want to changed our network settings over to NAT Network:</b>

<b>Currently in 'Settings' we want to select 'Network' and in attached to drop down menu we need to select 'NAT Network' and we need to choice from 'name' our AD project NAT Network and press 'OK':</b>

<b>and we can do this for all our our virtual machines:</b>

<b>So heading into our Splunk machine in Virtual Box if I type in 'IP a' we'll get IP address of 192.168.10.9</b>

<b>From our diagram we set the static IP of '.10' so that means we'll have to set up a static IP on our Splunk server to reflect that and to do that we'll have to type in 'sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml':</b>

<b>Ensure DHCP is set to no and configure the following settings from PrtScn below:</b>

<b>Then we want to clear the screen by type in 'clear' and type in 'sudo netplan apply'</b>

<b>We will get couple of warrnings about permissions but since we are on home lab environment it's fine to ingore:</b>

<b>We can clear our screen again by 'clear' and type in 'ip a' again and we now should see our IP address as 192.168.10.10/24</b>

<b>We have connectivity and we have our static IP set we can begin instaling Splunk.</b>
