<b>Objective: Todays objective is to installing and configuring Sysmon and Splunk on your Windows target machines and server within a VirtualBox environment. This setup will enable them to collect system telemetry and forward logs to the Splunk server for analysis.</b>

<p>Sysmon (System Monitor) is a system monitoring and logging tool that is a part of the Windows Sysinternals Suite. It generates much more detailed and expansive logs than the default Windows logs, and it provides a great, free alternative to many of the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions available.</p>

<b>To begin you want to head over to our virtual box and we want to make sure that our network settings are set to NAT network this way our virtual machines can be on the same network and still have internet access to do this open Virual Box: </b>

<b>At the bottom give your network a name (e.g., AD Project) and I'll have the ipv4 prefix as our IP that we put in our diagram 192.168.10.0/24 and I will leave enable DHCP and I will hit apply:</b>
